# Javascript Raytracer Tutorial

This is my implementation as I follow the tutorial here:

https://avik-das.github.io/build-your-own-raytracer/

## Getting Started 

This uses webpack for the build process. 
As of lesson 1, there is no `webpack.config.js`, just run webpack since 
`index.js` is in `src/` and the default build of `dist/main.js` works.
